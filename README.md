# RSSer
## What is it?
A quick and dirty RSS feed. The worst Twitter clone in existence.

## What does it do?
It sits behind a reverse proxy, accepts host-based forwarding, and exposes for each:
- A form that can be used to update, based on a backend-set password (told you this was quick-and-dirty)
- An RSS-formatted feed of these updates, suitable for your favourite reader
- A text-formatted feed for ease of use

## Why?
Sometimes you want simple multicast status updates that don't rely on an external entity and can be consumed in a variety of ways by common tools that most people will have available in any case.

Also I like RSS.
